__Visualising SIRS Model of Epidemic Spread__

We simulate the SIRS model of epidemic spread to try and explain the trajectories of different variables as the disease progresses in a population.

Parameters that can be played around with:

R<sub>0</sub> - the average number of people that an infected person passes on the disease to.
