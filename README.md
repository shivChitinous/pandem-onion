__Visualising SIRS Model of Epidemic Spread__

[Check out artice here!](https://shivchitinous.github.io/pandem-onion/SIRS_Model_of_Epidemic_Spread.html)

I simulate the SIRS model of epidemic spread to try and explain the trajectories of different variables as the disease progresses in a population.

Parameters that can be played around with:

R<sub>0</sub> - the average number of people that an infected person passes on the disease to.
